# EHR-based-Intubation-Predictor-
Open-source tool using electronic health records (EHR) data for predicting invasive mechanical ventilation. Timely assessments, transparent insights, and user-friendly interface.
The EHR-Based Intubation Predictor is an open-source tool that leverages electronic health records (EHR) data to predict the need for invasive mechanical ventilation in patients. It utilizes machine learning algorithms and predictive modeling techniques to assist healthcare professionals in making timely and informed decisions related to patient management and resource allocation.

Features:

Seamless integration with existing EHR systems for data extraction
Predictive modeling based on comprehensive patient information
Real-time predictions for assessing the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation
Transparent and interpretable insights into prediction outcomes
User-friendly interface for easy implementation and usage

This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources for the EHR-Based Intubation Predictor. It aims to provide healthcare practitioners and researchers with an accessible and effective tool for identifying patients at higher risk of requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.
