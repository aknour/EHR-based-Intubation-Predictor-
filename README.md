# Food Access Disparities Bay Area
An in-depth analysis of food access disparities in the Bay Area, investigating the link between obesity rates and various determinants like geographic location, food deserts/swamps, income, and more. Using data science to spotlight and challenge deeply entrenched nutritional inequalities in the region.

An extensive data-driven exploration of food access disparities in California's Bay Area. This project delves into:

###  Geographical Analysis:
Differentiating between urban and rural areas, mapping food desert and food swamp designations.
###  Socio-Economic Indicators:
Examining how factors such as income levels, race demographics, and vehicle access influence food accessibility.
###  Health Indicators:
Investigating correlations between obesity rates, physical inactivity, and access to exercise opportunities.
###  Food Environment Index:
A comprehensive metric providing insights into food choices and health outcomes.
###  Deep Learning Predictor:
Utilizing advanced machine learning to forecast demand for farmer's markets in various locations.
###  Policy Implications:
Insights to inform actionable strategies for better food systems and equitable access.

## Drawn from my personal observations in the Bay Area, this analysis leverages data science to challenge and spotlight the root causes of nutritional inequalities in the region.
